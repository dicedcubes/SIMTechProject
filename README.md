# SIMTechProject
Public-Facing Repository for SIMTech Project.

This is a data analysis/machine learning chatbot that can read data files and use machine learning algorithms to analyze them.

To use, create a .env file with your 'OPENAI_API_KEY' in the directory above MainProject. Drop any data files (Currently supporting csv) into a 'data' folder, also in the directory above MainProject.

This is still a work in progress! In the future I hope to integrate RAG and few-shot prompting for more accurate and consistent response generation, as well as more algorithms and techniques like K-means and neural networks, and quality-of-life features like session control and online hosting.
